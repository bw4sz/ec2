#### I. Installing and configuring Git LFS locally

You will need Git LFS if you plan to commit any files > 100 MB in size. The MCMC output from the penguin model could easily exceed this size given the number of parameters involved, making Git LFS a must. This section describes installing Git LFS locally. Later on we describe how to install Git LFS on your EC2 instance, as it does not come pre-installed with the AMI we will be working with. Remeber, Git LFS costs money, and you first need to subscribe to this service on [GitHub](http://www.github.com).

Getting Git LFS to work correctly on the Mac can be confusing, so here are the steps. **Make sure you do not have any large files (>100MB) commits before doing this!**

1.  Install homebrew from the terminal.

    ```bash
    bash /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)
    ```

2.  Install Git LFS using homebrew.

    ```bash
    brew install git-lfs
    ```

3.  Make sure that Git and Git LFS are both located in the same directory, your `/usr/local/bin`.

4.  Add /usr/local/bin to your path.

    ```bash
    echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:~/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
    ```

5.  Type `which git` in the terminal to make sure you are using the git installation in `/usr/local/bin`.

6.  If using Tower, select this version of git under Preferences, Git Config:

<br><center>
<div style="width:500px; height=500px">
![alt text](ReadMeImage1.png)
</div>
<br></center>

7.  Before you do any commits involving large files, either create or amend the .gitattributes file to associate a file type with Git LFS. From the terminal type 
    ```bash 
    git lfs track *.*
    ```
    
    where the astericks indicate which names or extensions of file you wish to associate with Git LFS. In our case this will be all rda files so type
    
    ```bash
    git lfs track *.rda
    ```
8.  Commit this change to .gitattributes and push it to the remote repository.

<br>

#### II. Using SSH with your Git repository

We will know generate an SSH key (two files - a public key that you share and a private key you keep safe) that we associate with our Git account. This will allow us to clone our Git repository on an EC2 instance without having to manually type in your username and password or (worse yet) put your password in cleartext when using a script.

1.  In terminal create an SSH key, substituting your email address.

    ```bash
    SSH-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C your_email@example.com
    ```

2.  Save the key to the default directory, `~/.ssh`.

3.  Skip entering a pass-phrase.

4.  Check that the public and private key are in  `~/.ssh` by going to the directory and typing `ls -l id_rsa*`. You should see two files, the public key named         `id_rsa.pub` and the private key named `id_rsa`.

    ```bash
    -rw-r--r--  1 coldwater  staff  3243 Mar 15 10:19 id_rsa
    -rw-r--r--  1 coldwater  staff   743 Mar 15 10:19 id_rsa.pub
    ```
5. From the terminal, make sure this private key is not publically viewable. 

    ```bash
    chmod 600 ~/.ssh/keyname
    ```

    For me, this is:
    
    ```bash
    chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    ```
    
6.  Check that this worked by typing `ls -l id_rsa*`. Notice that now the private key can only be read and written to by me, while the public key can still be read by everyone.
    
    ```bash
    -rw-------  1 coldwater  staff  3243 Mar 15 10:19 id_rsa
    -rw-r--r--  1 coldwater  staff   743 Mar 15 10:19 id_rsa.pub
    ```
    
7.  Go to the settings under your [GitHub account](http//www.github.com).

8.  Click SSH keys and New SSH key.

9.  In terminal copy your public key to the clipboard.

    ```bash
    pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    ```
10.  Paste this into the key box on github.com and click save. This key is available to ALL your Git repositories.

<br>

#### III. Configuring and launching an Amazon EC2 instance

OK, let's configure and launch our Amazon EC2 instance. We can access it via the browser, as well as SSH from the terminal. An instance is a virtual machine that runs an AMI, which specifices its software configuration. You can start with a bare-bones unbuntu image and install R, etc, but that is time consuming. Fortunately, there are many community AMI's available that are preconfigured for different tasks.  Louis Aslett has created an [RStudio Server AMI](http://www.louisaslett.com/RStudio_AMI/) that we will use.

1.  Go to the [EC2 Dashboard](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-west-2#) under the [AWS Management Console](https://us-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/console/home?region=us-west-1).

2.  Make sure the region selected in the top right is as close to you as possible. If not change it.

3.  Click launch instance.

4.  Click community AMIs, and type in `ami-d1e792b1`. This is the [RStudio Server AMI](http://www.louisaslett.com/RStudio_AMI/) matching my region (Oregon).

5.  Select Free-Tier eligible to get started. Later as you do more intensive runs, you can alter these hardware settings.

6.  Under configure instance details, select `terminate` under shutdown behavior. Leave the other options as is.

7.  Leave storage and tag instance options as is.

8.  Under security group, click add rule, and select HTTP. These rules are what allow you to connect to your instance via the web (port 80) or via SSH (port 22). Don't worry about the warning. Nobody can access this instance without your private key, which only you have.

9.  Click launch instance and select create a key pair. Name and download your private key. Remove the .txt extension from the private key. Move the key to `~/.ssh` by typing in the terminal 

    ```bash
    mv /path/keyname.pem ~/.ssh/keyname.pem
    ```

    For me, that would be:

    ```bash
    mv /Users/coldwater/Downloads/CheCastaldoAmazon.pem ~/.ssh/CheCastaldoAmazon.pem
    ```

10. In the terminal, make sure this private key is not publically viewable.

    ```bash
    chmod 400 /path/keyname.pem
    ``` 
    For me that would be 
    
    ```bash
    chmod 400 ~/.ssh/CheCastaldoAmazon.pem
    ```

11.  Check that this worked by typing `ls -l CheCastaldoAmazon.pem`. Notice that access to this file is even more restricted than the Git private key.
    
    ```bash
    -r--------@ 1 coldwater  staff  1692 Mar 15 11:42 CheCastaldoAmazon.pem
    ```
    
11. Click view instances. From this screen you can control your instance, as well as make changes to it. Note, stopping your instance is not the same as terminating it. If you want to kill an instance, you must use terminate.

<br>

#### IV. Accessing an Amazon EC2 instance in the browser

Once you instance state is green (running) you can access it from the terminal or through the web browser. 

1.  From the web, copy the Public DNS link and paste it into a new browser tab. 

<br><center>
<div style="width:750px; height=750px">
![alt text](ReadMeImage2.png)
</div>
<br></center>

2. Log in to R studio using the username `rstudio` and the password `rstudio`. Welcome to your Amazon EC2 instance! To access the command line here, click shell, under tools. 

<br>

#### V. Accessing an Amazon EC2 instance via SSH

Here we access your instance via SSH from the terminal. Why do this? Simple - script automation and scalability.

1. First we will, secure copy our Git Hub private key to the ec2 instance. That way it is there when we log in and we can clone our Git repository. To do this move to the `~/.ssh` directory in terminal and type:

    ```bash
    scp -i ~/.ssh/AmazonPrivateKeyname.pem GitPrivateKeyname user_name@public_dns_name:~/.ssh/
    ```

    For me this is:

    ```bash
    scp -i ~/.ssh/CheCastaldoAmazon.pem id_rsa ubuntu@ec2-52-35-131-165.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:~/.ssh/
    ```

2. Now, from the terminal, SSH into your instance. 

    ```bash
    ssh -i /path/AmazonPrivateKey.pem user_name@public_dns_name
    ```
  
    For me this is:
      
    ```bash    
    ssh -i ~/.ssh/CheCastaldoAmazon.pem ubuntu@ec2-52-35-131-165.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
    ```
    
    After which you will say yes and see something similar to the following. Again, welcome to your Amazon EC2 instance!
    
    ```bash
    The authenticity of host 'ec2-52-35-131-165.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com (52.35.131.165)' can't be established.
    ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:iwfo8uhyBDJAthQQjxWnkcRSKK9XqE+0hSmr96zLHRQ.
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
    Warning: Permanently added 'ec2-52-35-131-165.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com,52.35.131.165' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.

    ubuntu@ip-172-31-30-91:~$ 
    ```

3. Type `ls -l ~/.ssh` and you should see your Git private key, with appropriate permissions, saved in the `~/.ssh` folder.

    ```bash
    -rw------- 1 ubuntu ubuntu  399 Mar 15 16:45 authorized_keys
    -rw------- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 3243 Mar 15 18:32 id_rsa
    ```
4. Sometimes as this point there is a permissions error, where the user ubuntu (you) is not the owner of the home directory. This make it impossible to clone your Git repository there. To check this type:

    ```bash
    cd /home
    cd ..
    ls -l
    ```
  Looking below, I see that root is the owner of home.
  
    ```bash
    ubuntu@ip-172-31-30-91:/$ ls -l
    total 76
    drwxr-xr-x   2 root root  4096 Dec 18 20:55 bin
    drwxr-xr-x   3 root root  4096 Dec 18 20:55 boot
    drwxr-xr-x  13 root root  3820 Mar 15 16:45 dev
    drwxr-xr-x  99 root root  4096 Mar 15 16:45 etc
    drwxr-xr-x   5 root root  4096 Mar 15 20:43 home
    ``` 
    
    To fix this I type:
      
    ```bash    
    sudo chown -R ubuntu:ubuntu /home
    ```
    
    And now, `ls -l` shows:
    
    ```bash
    ubuntu@ip-172-31-30-91:/$ ls -l
    total 76
    drwxr-xr-x   2 root root      4096 Dec 18 20:55 bin
    drwxr-xr-x   3 root root      4096 Dec 18 20:55 boot
    drwxr-xr-x  13 root root      3820 Mar 15 16:45 dev
    drwxr-xr-x  99 root root      4096 Mar 15 16:45 etc
    drwxr-xr-x   5 ubuntu ubuntu  4096 Mar 15 20:43 home
    ``` 

5. FYI, to logout, type `exit`. Note this doesn't kill the EC2 instance! You are just logged out of it. Go back to the [EC2 Dashboard](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-west-2#) and your instance still will be running.

<br>

#### VI. Cloning a Git repository on your Amazon EC2 instance
 
The good news is git is installed be default on this AMI. However, the bad news is we still need to install Git LFS and securely get our private key onto our instance so we can clone our repository.

1. From the terminal, run a script from [packagecloud](https://packagecloud.io/github/git-lfs/install) that allows us to install Git LFS using apt-get utility.

    ```bash
    curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/github/git-lfs/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
    ```

2. Now install Git LFS. 

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install git-lfs
    ```

3. Typing `which git` shows the Git install in `/usr/bin/` on your instance. Typing `ls -l /usr/bin/git*` shows Git and Git LFS in the same folder, which is exactly where they need to be.

4. Go to the repository you wish to clone on [GitHub account](http//www.github.com) and copy the SSH link for the master branch under the code tab.

<br><center>
<div style="width:750px; height=750px">
![alt text](ReadMeImage3.png)
</div>
<br></center>

5. In the terminal, move to the home directory and then clone the master branch to this Amazon EC2 instance. Now your Git repository is cloned to the home directory of your Amazon EC2 instance.

    ```bash
    cd /home
    git clone git@github.com:CCheCastaldo/MAPPPD-Model.git
    ```
    
<br>

#### VII. Installing and configuring the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)

When you log into the AWS website, you use a username (email) and password to verify who you are. To use the CLI, you will not authenticate using a username/password but instead with an access key. This is a little confusing, so remember this access key indentifies who you are to AWS. This is different from the key pair you use to connect to an instance ([III. Configuring and launching an Amazon EC2 instance][]). This is like being on a guest list to get into a convention (your AWS access key) and then having a ticket for a specific event (your instance) at the convention (your key pair).

1. Create an AWS access key by going to security credentials in the [AWS console](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/console/home?region=us-west-1).

<br><center>
<div style="width:750px; height=750px">
![alt text](ReadMeImage4.png)
</div>
<br></center>

2. Click Create New Access Key. The key is composed of two parts, your public Access Key ID and your Secret Access Key. Both of these parts are saved in a text file which you should download now.

<br><center>
<div style="width:750px; height=750px">
![alt text](ReadMeImage5.png)
</div>
<br></center>

3. Like before, let's move the key to `~/.ssh`. I'll rename it now too and change the security credentials.

    ```bash
    mv /Users/coldwater/Downloads/rootkey.csv ~/.ssh/CheCastaldoAmazonAWS.csv
    chmod 400 ~/.ssh/CheCastaldoAmazonAWS.csv
    ```
    
4. Check that it python is installed by typing `python --version` in terminal.

5. If not, download and install the latest 2.7 package from the [python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

6. Download and unzip the [AWS CLI Bundled Installer](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html#install-bundle-other-os)

    ```bash
    cd /users/coldwater/downloads
    curl "https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-cli/awscli-bundle.zip" -o "awscli-bundle.zip"
    unzip awscli-bundle.zip
    ```
    
7. Install the command line tools. From [AWS](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html#install-bundle-other-os), this command "installs the AWS CLI at /usr/local/aws and create the symlink aws at the /usr/local/bin directory. Using the -b option to create a symlink eliminates the need to specify the install directory in the user's $PATH variable. This should enable all users to call the AWS CLI by typing aws from any directory."

    ```bash
    sudo ./awscli-bundle/install -i /usr/local/aws -b /usr/local/bin/aws
    ```

8. Check the install with `/usr/local/bin/aws --version`. You should see the aws-cli version.

    ```bash
    aws-cli/1.10.13 Python/2.7.10 Darwin/15.3.0 botocore/1.4.4
    ```

9. Type `aws configure`. You should now enter your access key id and secret access key from your AWS access key. To see these values quickly just type `cat ~/.ssh/CheCastaldoAmazonAWS.csv` in the terminal. Next chose the [geographic region code](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html) closest to you. You can leave the output format blank (hit enter).

    ```bash
    AWS Access Key ID [None]: AKIAIWPG6RASEO27MEUA
    AWS Secret Access Key [None]: blahblahblah
    Default region name: us-west-1 
    Default output format [None]: 
    ```

10. The CLI stores the key information in a file named `credentials` and the region and output format in a file called `config` both in `~\.aws`.

    ```bash
    Christians-MacBook-Pro:.aws coldwater$ ls -la
    total 16
    drwxr-xr-x   4 coldwater  staff   136 Mar 16 10:51 .
    drwxr-xr-x+ 34 coldwater  staff  1156 Mar 16 10:49 ..
    -rw-------   1 coldwater  staff    29 Mar 16 10:51 config
    -rw-------   1 coldwater  staff   116 Mar 16 10:41 credentials
    ```

11. Define a [security group](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-ec2-sg.html) and add a rule for SSH access. that you will use for your EC2 instances. The vpic-id corresponds to the [EC2-VPC](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/default-vpc.html) from your chosen region. You can create your own, or use the default, which can be found at Networking-VPC tab in the [AWS Management Console](https://us-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/console/home?region=us-west-1).

    ```bash
    aws ec2 create-security-group --group-name CheCastaldoDefaultSecurity --description "Default Security Group" --vpc-id vpc-9c5726f9
    ```
    
12. Add rule to this security group to allow SSH access to your EC2 over port 22 from any machine.

    ```bash
    aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-name CheCastaldoDefaultSecurity --protocol tcp --port 22 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
    ```

13. To see or delete any of these security groups type the following in terminal. These security groups will also be available to you if you launch an instance through the AWS console. Also, this is how you find the security group id, which you will need to launch your instance.

    ```bash
    aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-names CheCastaldoDefaultSecurity
    aws ec2 delete-security-group --group-name CheCastaldoDefaultSecurity
    ```

14. If you haven't done so already, you can create a key pair from the terminal. It is best to do this in the `~/.ssh` directory. Also alter the persmission on this key to be seen only by you. 

    ```bash
    aws ec2 create-key-pair --key-name CheCastaldoAmazon --query 'KeyMaterial' --output text > CheCastaldoAmazon.pem
    chmod 400 ~/.ssh/CheCastaldoAmazon.pem
    ```

15. To see or delete any of these key pairs type the following in terminal. Like security groups, this key will also be available to you if you launch an instance through the AWS console.

    ```bash
    aws ec2 describe-key-pairs
    aws ec2 delete-key-pair --key-name CheCastaldoAmazon
    ```
    
<br>

#### VIII. Using CLI to create and connect to EC2 instances

Let's, use the run-instances command to specify the instance details. The command below specifies creates with a single CLI command an instance identical to the one we set up in Section III. Later on in this section we will combine all these commands into a single shell script, that you can exeute from the command line. For more details see [Launching an Instance Using the Amazon EC2 CLI](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/CommandLineReference/ec2-cli-launch-instance.html) in the AW documentation.

1. Launch EC2 instance from terminal. Notice we supply the hardware configuration, the ami, the number of instances we wish to create, the name of our key pair, and our secutirity group. We also specify the shotdown behavior. Finally, we query the output from this command to get the instance id, which we save to a variable of the same name.

    ```bash
    instance_id=$(aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-d1e792b1 --security-group-ids sg-7342b517 --count 1 --instance-type t2.micro --key-name CheCastaldoAmazon --instance-initiated-shutdown-behavior terminate --query 'Instances[0].{d:InstanceId}' --output text)
    ```
    
2. Wait until the instance is up and running before doing anything else. We really need the Public DNS to access this instance, but it takes Amazon a few minutes to create our instance in the first place. The wait command will only finish after the condition is met, here it is when our particular instance is running.

    ```bash
    aws ec2 wait instance-running --instance-ids $instance_id
    ```

3. Save the public DNS on of the instance you just created to a variable called dns. To see it type`echo $dns`.

    ```bash
    dns=$(aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids $instance_id --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].PublicDnsName' --output text | grep a)
    ```

4. Secure copy our Git Hub private key to the EC2 instance. The o, UserKnownHostsFile, StrictHostKeyChecking options removes the host verification prompt (the computer asks you to type yes or no to continue). Removing this is essential if we want to run these actions in a script.

    ```bash
    scp -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -i ~/.ssh/CheCastaldoAmazon.pem ~/.ssh/id_rsa ubuntu@$dns:~/.ssh/
    ````

5. Now lets put all this together with the following script called Startup.bash.

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    
    --instance-initiated-shutdown-behavior terminate --query 'Instances[0].{d:InstanceId}' --output text)

    # wait until instance is up and running
    aws ec2 wait instance-running --instance-ids $instance_id

    # retrieve public dns
    dns=$(aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids $instance_id --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].PublicDnsName' --output text | grep a)

    # secure copy git private key to instance
    scp -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -i ~/.ssh/CheCastaldoAmazon.pem ~/.ssh/id_rsa ubuntu@$dns:~/.ssh/

    # change permissons so ubuntu can write to home directory
    ssh -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -i ~/.ssh/CheCastaldoAmazon.pem ubuntu@$dns "sudo chown -R ubuntu:ubuntu /home"

    # copy over Job.bash to instance
    scp -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -i ~/.ssh/CheCastaldoAmazon.pem /users/coldwater/Desktop/Job.bash ubuntu@$dns:/home

    # run job script on instance
    ssh -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -i ~/.ssh/CheCastaldoAmazon.pem ubuntu@$dns "bash Job.bash &"
    ```

    Which call thie script called Job.bash.
    
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    ~/.ssh/config

    echo 'Host * StrictHostKeyChecking no' > ~/.ssh/config

    curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/github/git-lfs/script.deb.sh | sudo bash

    cd /usr/bin

    sudo apt-get install git-lfs
 
    cd /home
 
    git clone git@github.com:CCheCastaldo/MAPPPD-Model.git
    ```
    
6. Put all this in a bash script and run it as.

    ```bash
    bash Startup.bash &> /users/coldwater/Desktop/AWSlog.txt
    ```  

7. FYI. To kill an instance remotely.

    ```bash
    ids=$(aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].InstanceId' --output text)
    aws ec2 terminate-instances --instance-ids $ids
    ```
